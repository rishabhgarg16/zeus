Renuka Thakur Singh got them off to a brilliant start by removing the top three Bangladeshi batters cheaply. The 2018 champions struggled to find any sort of momentum with the bat. Not only were boundaries tough to find, they also struggled to rotate strike. Nigar Sultana and Shorna Akter were the only Bangladesh batters to get to double-digits. Radha Yadav capped off the innings with a double-wicket maiden and India restricted Bangladesh 80/8. The chase, as expected, turned out to be a cakewalk for the defending champions. Smriti Mandhana hit a flurry of boundaries and India wiped off more than 50 percent of the target inside 5 overs. The result was a foregone conclusion. Jahanara had Mandhana caught at backward point on 35 but the pacer had overstepped by a long way. Shafali Verma, not at her fluent best today, was dropped in the following over. The stylish left-hander finished it off in style. A hat-trick of boundaries and got to her fifty in the process as well as India romped home with 9 overs to spare.",
